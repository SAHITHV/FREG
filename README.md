Introduction :

The Advanced Face Recognition Student Attendance System is a Python-based application that utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to automate the process of taking attendance in classrooms or any other educational setting. The system is capable of recognizing students' faces and marking their attendance in real-time.

Features :

- Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Tkinter library for easy interaction.
- Utilizes the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm for accurate face recognition.
- Python OpenCV library for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- Python database integration to store and manage student information and attendance records.
- Implementation of Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection.
- Automatic training of the face recognition model using labeled face data.
- Real-time face recognition for efficient attendance marking.

Technologies Used :

- Python
- Tkinter
- OpenCV (Python)
- SQLite or any other Python database library


Installation :

1. Clone the repository:

 
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-attendance.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   
   cd face-recognition-attendance
   

3. Install the required dependencies:
 
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install opencv-contrib-python
   pip install tk
   pip install sqlite3  

Usage :

1. Run the main application:

   python main.py
 
2. The GUI will be launched, and you can perform various actions, such as adding students, marking attendance, and managing the database.


Training the Model :

1. The face recognition model will automatically train when you add new student data. The labeled face data will be used to create a recognition model.

Marking Attendance :

1. Use the "Mark Attendance" button on the GUI to start recognizing faces and marking attendance.
